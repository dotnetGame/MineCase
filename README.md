`MineCase` is a cross-platform application with distributed server of `Minecraft`. 
The project is designed to create a high-performance, distributed system by using isolating different components through actor mode. 
Different chunks are managed by different servers so that all players can play in a world. This makes minecraft servers more scalable.
It written in `C#` with `.NET Core 2.0` env and based on `orleans` framework to work with released [1.12 protocol](https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-112-pre-release-6).

**MineCase is not stable and lack of many features now. Please don't use MineCase in production unless you know what you're doing.**
